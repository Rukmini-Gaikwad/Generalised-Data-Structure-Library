# Generalised-Data-Structure-Library
This program implements a reusable Generic Data Structure Library in C++ using templates.
It provides Queue, Stack, Singly/Doubly Linear & Circular Linked Lists, and a Binary Search Tree.
Each data structure supports basic operations like insert, delete, display, count, push/pop, enqueue/dequeue.
Templates allow all structures to store any data type (int, float, string, custom types).
